not finished, no op-codes definied yet

bit widths/heights/depth can be adjusted in file settings to be written to fpga

TO DO:
-connect top level convolutional layer, flatten, fully_connected_layer, max_pooling, output_layer in top level controller
-create opcodes for that thang
-upload that thang onto the soc fpga
-create python script to train that thang on the soc, drivers for python, and memory storage for the output

-optimize for better performance on that thang hawk tuah and spit on that thang
